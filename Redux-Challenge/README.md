# Weekend Redux Challenges for 3rd March 2018

I have created separate scripts for each of these challenges.

All you have to do is use your command line to change directory into the `6th-week-redux-sessions` folder and run

```js
npm run one
npm run two
etc
```

1.  Create a redux store with initial data
2.  Upgrade user's plan
3.  Change user's location
4.  Add a new plan
5.  Change the `contact me` status by toggling the `can_chat` flag
